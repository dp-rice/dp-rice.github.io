## Population genetics theory and data analysis

I am a mathematical and computation biologist. I work at NIH/NCBI (contractor) developing [codeathons](https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/event/beyond-phylogenies-visualization-codeathon-07-22/) and [workshops](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/drice-codeathons/workshop-ncbi-data-with-python/main?filepath=notebooks%2Fworkshop.py) to help biologists solve computational problems and learn data science skills.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Novembre Lab](http://jnpopgen.org/) at the University of Chicago. 
I completed my PhD in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology with [Michael Desai](http://www.desai-lab.com/) at Harvard.

You can find my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2zS2I7UAAAAJ&hl=en).
